# Architecture of Thermodynamic Emergence (ATE)

**Institute:** Advanced Research in Complex Systems
**Principle:** "Information is Physical" (Landauer)

This repository contains the computational implementation and theoretical foundation of the **Thermodynamic Emergence Framework**, which unifies Gravity, Social Dynamics, and Consciousness under a single mathematical formalism based on Entropy.

## 📄 Core Documentation

*   [**UNIFIED_THEORY.md**](./UNIFIED_THEORY.md): The formal resolution of the General Relativity vs. Quantum Mechanics conflict via Entropic Gravity.
*   [**RESEARCH_OBJECTIVE.md**](./RESEARCH_OBJECTIVE.md): The original manifesto and hypothesis validation status (December 2025).

## 🔬 Research Modules

The project is divided into three scales of emergence, each in its own subdirectory:

### 1. Cosmic Scale: `Entropic_Gravity/`
Astrophysical simulations testing the emergent gravity hypothesis.
*   **Focus:** Galaxy Rotation Curves, Cosmology without Dark Matter.
*   **Key Codes:** `src/rotacao_galactica.py`, `src/simulacao_galaxia.py`.

### 2. Macro-Social Scale: `Social_Event_Horizons/`
Modeling societies as spin systems (Ising Model) under influence of information fields.
*   **Focus:** Political hysteresis, polarization, totalitarianism as a low-entropy state.

### 3. Micro-Conscious Scale: `Interbrain_Coupling/`
Computational neuroscience focused on phase synchronization.
*   **Focus:** Consciousness as a phase transition in coupled oscillators (Kuramoto).

## 🚀 How to Run Simulations

We recommend a Python 3.9+ environment with scientific computing support.

```bash
# Install dependencies (generic example)
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib astropy jupyter

# Run the validation of galactic rotation curves
cd Entropic_Gravity/src
python rotacao_galactica.py
```

## ⚠️ Epistemological Note

This repository adopts the **Code-First Physics** methodology. Theories that cannot be implemented in code are considered incomplete. Numerical validation takes precedence over analytical elegance.
