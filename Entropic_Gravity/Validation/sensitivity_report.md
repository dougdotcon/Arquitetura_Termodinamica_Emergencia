# Sensitivity Analysis Report

## Objective
Evaluate if the flat rotation curve is a fine-tuned result or a robust feature.

## Results
Tested variations of `a_0`: -30% to +30%

| Variation | Flatness Error (CoV) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| -30% | 0.00% | Stable |
| -20% | 0.00% | Stable |
| Baseline | 0.00% | Stable |
| +20% | 0.00% | Stable |
| +30% | 0.00% | Stable |

**Conclusion:** Maximum variation in flatness is 0.00%.
[SUCCESS] **ROBUST.** The qualitative feature (flatness) persists across parameter variations.
