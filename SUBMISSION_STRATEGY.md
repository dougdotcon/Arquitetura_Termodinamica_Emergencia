# SUBMISSION STRATEGY: From Code to Canon
**Objective:** Legitimization of Independent Research on Emergent Gravity.

---

## Phase 1: The "Outsider" Foundation (Immediate)
*Goal: Secure authorship and timestamp (provenance) without relying on gatekeepers.*

1.  **Affiliation Strategy:**
    -   **Adopt:** "Independent Researcher".
    -   **Reject:** Fictitious Institutes. Transparency creates trust.
    -   **Narrative:** "Computational audit of physical theories" (The Hacker/Auditor Persona).

2.  **Code Preservation (The Real Asset):**
    -   **Action:** Release the Python Validation Suite.
    -   **License:** MIT or Apache 2.0 (Open Science).
    -   **DOI Generation:** Connect GitHub repo to **Zenodo**. This makes the *code* citable independently of the paper.
        -   *Title:* "EntropicGravity-Py: A Numerical Validation Framework".

3.  **Preprint Upload:**
    -   **Target:** **OSF Preprints** (Open Science Framework) or **Zenodo**.
    -   **Why:** No "Endorsement" required (unlike arXiv). Google Scholar indexes OSF.
    -   **Deliverable:** Upload `PAPER_DRAFT.pdf` (compiled from the Markdown).

## Phase 2: The Peer Review Ladder (Medium Term)
*Goal: Formal validation.*

### Option A: The "Software" Backdoor (High Success Probability)
-   **Journal:** **JOSS (Journal of Open Source Software)**.
-   **Focus:** They review the **quality of the code/software**, not the novelty of the physics.
-   **Benefit:** If accepted, you get a formal citation. "Fulber (2025). EntropicGravity: A Python package for..."
-   **Leverage:** Once published in JOSS, "real" physics journals look at you differently. You are a published author of scientific software.

### Option B: The "Idea" Front Door (High Difficulty)
-   **Journal:** **Entropy** (MDPI).
-   **Fit:** Perfect thematic fit. Open Access (requires fees, but waivers exist for independent researchers sometimes).
-   **Journal:** **Physics Open** (Elsevier).
-   **Strategy:** Submit *after* the preprint gets some views/downloads.

---

## Phase 3: Community Engagement (The "Guerilla" Marketing)
-   **Twitter/X Physics Twitter:** Share the *plots* (visuals sell). "Reproducing Verlinde (2016) in 300 lines of Python."
-   **Reddit r/Physics:** Post in the weekly discussion or show-off Sunday. Be humble: "I simulated this to check if it works, here is the code."
