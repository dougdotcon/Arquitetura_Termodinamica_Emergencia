# Cover Letter for Submission to MDPI Entropy

**To:** The Editorial Board of Entropy (MDPI)
**Date:** December 28, 2025
**Subject:** Submission of Research Article: "Numerical Validation of Galactic Rotation Curves in an Emergent Gravity Framework"

Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit the attached manuscript entitled "**Numerical Validation of Galactic Rotation Curves in an Emergent Gravity Framework**" for consideration of publication in *Entropy*.

This work directly addresses the intersection of **Information Theory** and **Gravitational Dynamics**, a core topic of your journal (specifically the section on "Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics").

**Key contributions of this study:**
1.  We provide a reproducible, open-source Python framework (DOI: [Insert Zenodo DOI here if available, or "Pending"]) that numerically validates the Entropic Gravity hypothesis (Verlinde, 2016) against real galaxy data from the SPARC database.
2.  We demonstrate that the "Dark Matter" signal in rotation curves can be mathematically recovered as an entropic response of the vacuum, without introducing non-baryonic particles.
3.  We show via effective refractive index approximation that this framework maintains consistency with first-order gravitational lensing observations, resolving a common critique of emergent gravity theories.

**Why this fits *Entropy*:**
The study posits that gravity is not a fundamental interaction but an emergent phenomenon driven by the entropy of holographic information. This aligns perfectly with the journal's aim to publish research on the concept of entropy and its applications in physics and information systems.

**Author Statement:**
I confirm that this manuscript is original, has not been published before and is not currently being considered for publication elsewhere. As an independent researcher, I declare no conflict of interest.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

**Douglas Henrique Machado Fulber**
